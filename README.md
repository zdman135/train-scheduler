# train-scheduler
fake train scheduler created to show an example of firebase

## Additional Notes:
1. The key issue for this project was determining the arrival time of a train based on any time within a 24 hour period provided by the user.

1. Once the user provided a time, must calculate whether the time is before or after the first train's arrival.

1. After the calculation the rest was pretty simple. Just display the data to the user.
